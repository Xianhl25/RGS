## Data

### Collection Equipment

* Motion Analysis: Motion Capture System
* Delsys: sEMG

### Experiment Protocol

* Pre-experiment was conducted to verify whether wearing an exoskeleton would have an adverse effect on the recognition of marker points and subsequent manipulation. Two sets of experiments were conducted, one without an exoskeleton for normal walking, and the other with an exoskeleton but without initiating normal walking.
* The experiments were conducted in each of the three wearing conditions: without the vertical body weight support system and exoskeleton (NOBMSEXO), with the vertical body weight support system (BWSON) and with the vertical body weight support system and exoskeleton (BMSEXOON), in two speeds: 0.8 m/s and 1.2 m/s.

## Scripts

* `VisualizeEMG`: visualize the sEMG data to error band diagrams.
